# Task-Organizer-Site

## Description
This is a Kanban board to create tasks. It starts off with a modal with task, due date & description inputs. When you press enter it will create a card with all of the details and delete button. If the due date is with more than 2 days, the card will be white. If the date is with in two days, it will be yellow and if it's beyond the due date, the card will turn red. The card will go into the first row, which is the "to-do row". You can move the cards to the "in progress" and "done" rows depending on status. There is also a delete button if the task is complete and you want to delete it.
