# Task-Organizer-Site

## Description
This is a Kanban board to create tasks. It starts off with the add task button which will bring up a modal with "Task", "Due Date" & "Description" inputs. When you press enter it will create a card with all of the details and delete button. If the due date is with more than 2 days away, the card will be white. If the date is with in two days, it will be yellow and if it's beyond the due date, the card will turn red. The card will go into the first row, which is the "to-do row". You can move the cards to the "in progress" and "done" rows depending on status. There is also a delete button if the task is complete and you want to delete it.
